# hsafx

## What is it?
A framework for beginning Java students to incorporate graphics into their programming. OOP and event-driven programming not necessary.

## Requirements
You must have a Java SDK that includes the Java FX graphics library. 
- BlueJ is one option @ https://www.bluej.org/.
- Another is Liberica's "Full" JDK @ https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/.
- Or you can get a standard JDK and install the FX package yourself.

## Origins and Forks
The hsafx framework is derived from [Holt Software Associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Holt) original "Ready to Program" Java package, which is no longer available.

Here's another version based on Holt Software Associates' and my original work, that still uses the Swing framework: https://github.com/salamander2/HSA2

## Presentations
A version of this work was presented at CEMC 2012 at the University of Waterloo
