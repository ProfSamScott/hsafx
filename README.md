# hsafx

## What is it?
A framework for beginning Java students to incorporate graphics into their programming. OOP and event-driven programming not necessary.

## Requirements
You must have a Java SDK that includes the Java FX graphics library. I recommend Liberica JDK "Full" version, which is already bundled with Java FX. https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/

## Origins and Forks
The hsafx framework is derived Holt Software Associates' original package, which is no longer available.

Here's another version based on Holt Software Associates' and my original work, that still uses the Swing framework: https://github.com/salamander2/HSA2
